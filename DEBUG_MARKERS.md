# 🔍 Debug Markers on Map

## ✅ **I've Added Debugging to Fix the Marker Issue**

The map should now show markers properly. Here's what I fixed:

### **🔧 Key Fixes:**
1. **✅ Added Debugging Logs** - Check browser console for detailed logs
2. **✅ Fixed Coordinate Range** - Smaller range for Rawalpindi-Islamabad area
3. **✅ Added Fallback Markers** - Test marker if no users found
4. **✅ Better Error Handling** - Custom icons with fallback to default
5. **✅ Added Labels** - Worker names on markers for visibility

### **🚀 How to Debug:**

#### **Step 1: Check Browser Console**
1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Go to Map View**
3. **Look for these logs:**
   - "Fetching workers from Firebase..."
   - "All workers found: X"
   - "Creating markers for users: X"
   - "Created marker for [Name] at: [coordinates]"
   - "Total markers created: X"

#### **Step 2: Check What You See**
- **If you see "All workers found: 0"** → No data in Firebase, demo data should show
- **If you see "Creating markers for users: 0"** → No users passed to map component
- **If you see "Total markers created: 0"** → Test marker should appear at center
- **If you see markers created but not visible** → Check coordinates in console

#### **Step 3: Test with Demo Data**
If no markers show, the demo data should automatically appear:
- **Ahmed Khan** - Electrician (F-8, Islamabad)
- **Fatima Sheikh** - Plumber (Cantt, Rawalpindi)
- **Usman Tariq** - Carpenter (F-7, Islamabad)

### **🎯 What Should Happen:**
1. **Map loads** with Rawalpindi-Islamabad focus
2. **Console shows** worker data being fetched
3. **Markers appear** with worker names as labels
4. **Click markers** to see worker details
5. **Test marker** appears if no workers found

### **🔍 Troubleshooting:**
- **No markers at all** → Check if Google Maps loaded properly
- **Markers created but not visible** → Check coordinates in console logs
- **Only test marker visible** → No worker data, check Firebase
- **Markers outside map view** → Coordinates might be wrong

The debugging logs will help identify exactly where the issue is! 🎯
